# Record-Contact-of-Customers-Digitally
This project enables business owners to record and keep track of their customers' name, phone number, temperature and the time it was recorded. 

1. The business owner creates a Facebook Page and prints out the QR code to it from https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/
2. The customers can then message their name and phone number through the page. FB will track the timestamp automatically.
3. The data will be passed through this website: https://joeng03.herokuapp.com/

Note that this project is still being developed. The site is up, but there are minor bug fixes to be done

Pros of recording the data digitally:

1. Lower risk of transmission of COVID-19 due to contact to a publicly-used pen
2. Reduces the wastage of paper
3. Less manpower needed to supervise the customers
