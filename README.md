# Record-Contact-of-Your-Customers-Digitally
This project enables business owners to record and keep track of their customers' name, phone number, temperature and the time it was recorded. 

1. Create a Facebook Page and print out the QR code to it from https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/
2. The customers can scan the QR code and send their details to the page. FB will track the timestamp automatically.
3. Download the messages from FB (A Simple tutorial at https://www.zapptales.com/en/download-facebook-messenger-chat-history-how-to/)
4. Extract the downloaded zip folder. Go to https://joeng03.herokuapp.com/ 
5. Click 'Choose File' and open EXTRACTED_FILE->messages->inbox->NAME_OF_YOUR_FB_PAGE->message_1.html. A neat CSV file(it can be opened      by Excel) is returned by the website.

Pros of recording contact of customers digitally:

1. Lower risk of transmission of COVID-19 due to contact to a pen used by many different customers
2. Reduces the wastage of paper
3. Less manpower needed to supervise the customers

*Customers should include their details in a single message, for example: NAME, PHONE_NUMBER, TEMPERATURE
