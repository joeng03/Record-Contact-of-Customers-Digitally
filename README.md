# Record-Contact-of-Customers-Digitally
This project enables business owners to record and keep track of their customers' name, phone number, temperature and the time it was recorded. 

1. The business owner creates a Facebook Page and prints out the QR code to it from https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/
2. The customers can then message their name and phone number through the page. FB will track the timestamp automatically.
3. The data will be passed through this website: https://joeng03.herokuapp.com/
