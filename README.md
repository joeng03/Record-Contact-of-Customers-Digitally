# Record-Contact-of-Customers-Digitally
This project enables business owners to record and keep track of their customers' name, phone number, temperature and the time it was recorded. 

1. The business owner creates a Facebook Page and prints out the QR code to it from https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/
2. The customers scan the QR code and sends their name and phone number through the page. FB will track the timestamp automatically.
3. The business owner downloads all the messages from the page (A simple tutorial at https://www.zapptales.com/en/download-facebook-messenger-chat-history-how-to/)
4. The message will be passed through this website: https://joeng03.herokuapp.com/
5. A neat CSV file( can be opened in Excel) is returned by the website.

Pros of recording contact of customers digitally:

1. Lower risk of transmission of COVID-19 due to contact to a pen used by many different customers
2. Reduces the wastage of paper
3. Less manpower needed to supervise the customers
